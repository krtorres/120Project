The animate.css project is a open source project that covers animation
in CSS. This covers animations from things like water animations to 
transition animations such as Fade In and Fade out. It also has other
animations such as zooms, rotates, sliding and many others. These can also
be used in javascript. It is also possible to change the speed of the animations
with a class.
